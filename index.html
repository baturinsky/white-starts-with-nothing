      Game is played by usual chess rules, but White start without any pieces.
      <br />
      Instead, each turn you drop one piece (starting with White King) on any
      empty square of white half of the board.
      <br />
      Pawns can't be dropped on the
      first row.
      <br />
      Dropping pieces is the only thing that you can do, because moves for
      both sides are made automatically by AI.
      <br />
      Goal is, naturally, for White to win, preferably fast.
      <br />
      <br />
      There are several scenarios, differing by starting position and how
      dropped pieces are selected.
      <br />
      If scenario requires you placing Black pieces, you do it on Black side of the board.
